 Custom License Matchers

Custom License Matchers

  Rat comes with a set of predefined license matchers, that can be used
  some typical licenses. However, they will not always be sufficient.
  In such cases, you may use a custom license matcher.

  A custom license matcher is an implementation of
  <<<org.apache.rat.analysis.IHeaderMatcher>>>. Suggest that your
  source files must contain a header like the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  /**
   * Yet Another Software License, 1.0
   *
   * Lots of text, specifying the users rights, and whatever ...
   */
------------------------------------------------------------------

  A very easy way to search for such headers would be to scan
  for the string "Yet Another Software License, 1.0". And here's
  how you would do that in your POM:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
        <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${currentVersion}</version>
        <configuration>
          <licenses>
            <license implementation="org.apache.rat.analysis.license.SimplePatternBasedLicense">
              <licenseFamilyCategory>YASL1</licenseFamilyCategory>
              <licenseFamilyName>Yet Another Software License (YASL) 1.0</licenseFamilyName>
              <notes></notes>
              <patterns>
                <pattern>Yet Another Software License, 1.0</pattern>
              </patterns>
            </license>
          </licenses>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
------------------------------------------------------------------

  The following terms are used in the example:

*-----------------------+-----------+
| licenseFamilyCategory | The license family category is a very short string (exactly 5 characters, preferrably no blanks),
|                       | which identifies the license. For example, this could be <<<ASL20>>> to identify the Apache
|                       | Software License, 2.0.
*-----------------------+-----------+
| licenseFamilyName     | The license family name is a longer string, which gives the licenses full name. For example,
|                       | this could be <<<Apache Software License, 2.0>>>.
*-----------------------+-----------+
| notes                 | You might specify additional notes here, like "Dual licensed GPL/MPL".
*-----------------------+-----------+
| patterns              | Specifies a set of patterns being searched. The source file is assumed to contain the
|                       | license header, if at least one of these patterns is found.
*-----------------------+-----------+
