   Publishing this site

How to publish the RAT website

   * Make your changes to the site xml and/or .apt files and commit.

   * Buildbot automatically notices the commit and creates a staging site to look at -

     See {{{http://ci.apache.org/projects/rat} http://ci.apache.org/projects/rat/}} which is always upto date within a minute of any commit.

   * Need to make changes?, no problem, go back to 1 and 2 as often as you like.

   * Happy with changes and ready to go live?

     Do 

+------------------------------------------+
mvn site
+------------------------------------------+

     then if successful do 

+------------------------------------------+
mvn site-deploy
+------------------------------------------+

     from your local machine in the root of your RAT checkout, this will scp the site file to 
     /www/incubator.apache.org/rat/ on minotaur (people.apache.org).

     If you have issues with 'mvn site' failing try running 'mvn clean' then 'mvn install package' before going back and running 'mvn site' again.

     If you experience an Out of Memory error <<java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space>> when running 'mvn site' try setting 'export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m' 
     or for windows 'set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m' first on the command line (or in your profile) and then try 'mvn site' again. Only when 'mvn site' is successful 
     should you then 'mvn site-deploy'

   * Wait for the hourly site sync to our www machines and the updated site will be live.
